For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by\\n0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He\\nsuccessfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but\\nbegan to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his\\nneurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. \\nDespite\\nthe changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted\\nprogressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.\\nThis has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the\\nbathroom leading to episodes of incontinence.

The patient was given his\\nhome pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  \\n\\nOn arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed.
